This is a sample input file for COSC 1436
assignment #10. Your program should encode this
file by adding 1 through 6 to the ASCII value of each
character in it. In your encoded file the first character should
be 'U'. The last character of the third line should be 'k'.
The encoded file should have the same number of lines as the input,
but will be unreadable. The last character of the last line will
be a '0'.
